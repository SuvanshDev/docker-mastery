# Docker Mastery

This project is intented to use with exercises for Docker Mastery course by tdevs.in.

## Environment Variables

This project uses below environment variables:
```shell
DB_URL #Example: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dockermastery Syntax: jdbc:mysql://<hostname>:<port>/<db_name>
DB_USERNAME # Username of databases Example: root
DB_PASSWORD # Password of database Example: root12345
```

Make sure your DB is up and running and an empty database is created.

For example, if you have a mysql instance running locally at port 3306, connect to it and create a new database schema using below command:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE dockermastery;
```

The DB URL will become `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dockermastery`

## Build Steps

This project uses JAVA 21 and Maven. Make sure you have that installed in the system.

This project has an inbuilt Maven wrapper `mvnw` that can be used to build, test, and run the project.

To Run this project, below command can be used:
```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
or
```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The Run will fail if above environment variables are not set. 

You can pass these environment variables as below:

On linux/macOs
```shell
export DB_URL="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dockermastery"
export DB_USERNAME=root
export DB_PASSWORD=root
```

On Windows:
```batch
set DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dockermastery
set DB_USERNAME=root
set DB_PASSWORD=root
```

As the application starts, it creates a table called `todo` and add a few rows to it.
The application runs at port `8080`

Once the application is started, you can go to your browser and go to url `http://localhost:8080/`. This will return the following response on your browser:
```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Finish Assignment",
      "description": "Complete the assignment on database management systems.",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Grocery Shopping",
      "description": "Buy milk, eggs, and bread from the supermarket.",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you are getting this output, your application is running correctly.
